## New Changes
There is quite a significant change in how logs are stored between NoTrack v0.8.x and NoTrack v0.9, so unfortunately there is no simple upgrade path. It will also mean that youâ€™ll be unable to view any of your historic DNS log records.
   
An uninstall and reinstall of NoTrack is required in order to use version 0.9.
   
Instructions:
* Uninstall NoTrack v0.8.11
* `sudo bash /opt/notrack/uninstall.sh`
* or `sudo bash ~/notrack/uninstall.sh`
   
Install NoTrack v0.9
```bash
wget https://gitlab.com/quidsup/notrack/raw/master/install.sh
bash install.sh
```
